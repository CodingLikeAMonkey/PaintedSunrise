GDAP
Goal - Decision - Action - Presentation

- The 4 communicational layers driving NPC and character actions
- Goal describes the primary (and secondary) long term goal that the NPC wants to achieve
- Decisions are the actual steps that the character desires to do in the moment to achieve said goal
- Actions validate or enforce (tag only) what is currently possible and what to perform
- Presentation is the lowest and simplest layer, it simply executes media, such as animation, vfx, audio, shaders etc.

Note:
- These 4 layers describe a communication and validation structure
- They themselves do NOT represent core systems or enforece anything apart from applying and passing components
- Movement, Hit-Hurtboxes, Interactions and other systems are handled in their respective domains
- The player character is a partial participent of GDAP. Instead of artifical goals, the input of the player must be interpreted and mapped to the most suitable Decisions.
This is to ensure, that the character system remains modular, stable and scalable and that the player can choose any number of creatures, be it huamoid, animalistic or anything else.
